# vision

The project consists of the following delivery files:
*	Jupyter Notebooks:	Exploratory analysis and Augmentation analysis files
*	Pipeline Config files:	Pipeline Config for Reference, Exp 1st, Exp 2nd and Exp augmentation
*	Video animation of the Exp augmentation: File is big (180M) so to upload it we had to split it. We spimply used a binary split. To get the expected file, simply run “cat animation* > animation.gif”
*	Report “vision.pdf”:	Project report
